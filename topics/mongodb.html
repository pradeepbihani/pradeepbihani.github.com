			<p>UnixWare provides several mechanisms that allow processes to exchange data and synchronize execution. The simpler of these 
			  mechanisms are pipes, named pipes, and signals. These are limited, however, in what they can do. For instance,
			  <ul>
			  <li>Pipes do not allow unrelated processes to communicate.</li><br>
			  <li>Named pipes allow unrelated processes to communicate, but they cannot provide private channels for pairs of communicating processes;
			  that is, any process with appropriate permission may read from or write to a named pipe.</li><br>
			  <li>Sending signals, via the kill system call, allows arbitrary processes to communicate, but the message consists 
			  only of the signal number.</li><br>
			  </ul>
			  UnixWare also provides an InterProcess Communication (IPC) package that supports three, 
			  more versatile types of interprocess communication. For example,
			  <ul>
			  <li>Messages allow processes to send formatted data streams to arbitrary processes.</li><br>
			  <li>Semaphores allow processes to synchronize execution.</li><br>
			  <li>Shared memory allows processes to share parts of their virtual address space.</li><br>
			</ul></p>

			<pre>
			  Before a message can be sent or received, a uniquely identified message queue and data structure must be created.

			  msgp points to a user defined buffer that must contain first a field of type long integer that will specify the type of the 
			  message, and then a data portion that will hold the text of the message
			  struct
			  {long mtype;    /* message type */
			  char mtext[];  /* message text */

			  msgp:
			  pointer to a buffer which to be send as message


			  msgsz : sie of the message

			  msgflg:

			  IPC_NOWAIT
			  1.set(msgflg=IPC_NOWAIT)

			  2.notset
			  the operation would block if the total number of bytes allowed on the specified message queue are in use

			  int msgrcv(int msqid, void *msgp,size_t msgsz, long msgtyp, int msgflg);
			  RETURN:
			  -1:On unsuccessul
			  number of bytes copied from queue

			  PARAMETERS:
			  msgp :
			  pointer to a structure in the user memory area that will receive the message.

			  msgsz
			  length of the message to be received. 
			  If its value is less than the message in the array, an error can be returned if desired (see the msgflg argument below).

			  msgtyp :
			  argument is used to pick the first message on the message queue of the particular type specified.
			  If it is equal to zero, the first message on the queue is received; 
			  if it is greater than zero, the first message of the same type is received; 
			  if it is less than zero, the lowest type that is less than or equal to its absolute value is received.


			  msgflg:
			  argument allows the ``blocking message operation'' to be performed 

			  IPC_NOWAIT
			  1.set(msgflg=IPC_NOWAIT)
			  if the IPC_NOWAIT flag is not set ((msgflg and IPC_NOWAIT) == 0); :
			  the operation would block if there is not a message on the message queue of the desired type (msgtyp) to be received. 
			  2.noset
			  If the IPC_NOWAIT flag is set, the system call will fail immediately when there is not message of the desired type on the queue. 

			  MSG_NOERROR 
			  1.set(msgflg=IPC_NOERROR)
			  MSG_NOERROR flag is set, the message is truncated to the length specified by the msgsz argument of msgrcv.
			  2.noset
			  the system call fail if the message is longer than the size to be received
